description: What "CIS" means and which people and companies were involved
---

[Our first post] explains that "cod" very likely stands for "coded"
(image) but does not explain what "cis" means. TL;DR: It's the acronym
for *Computer and Information Sciences, Inc.*, a company that was
involved in the implementation of the Lightning Strike image codec.

## Infinop, Inc. and Computer and Information Sciences, Inc.
The [Lightning Strike image codec] was distributed by a company named
*Infinop, Inc.* and there are several links between that company and
*Computer and Information Sciences, Inc.* I first stumbled over the
latter name (that can be abbreviated as *CIS, Inc.*) in the
publication [Dissemination of compressed Satellite imagery within the
Navy SPAWAR Central Site Product Display
environment](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19960008292) ([archived
tar.gz with all HTML documents from the host
www.compsci.com][SIMDC95.tar.gz]) that was published on October 1,
1995, at *The 1995 Science Information Management and Data Compression
Workshop*. Looking at [it's archived web page][compsci.com] we see a
directory listing with two folders – [infinop] and [lstrike] that link
CIS, Inc. to Infinop, Inc. and the Lightning Strike image codec. The
[windows subdirectory] of the "infinop" directory contains the
executables [ls16tiny.exe], [ls32tiny.exe], and [lstplug.exe] that
contain 16 and 32 bit variants of the Lightning Strike [web browser
plugin](documentation.html#web-browser-plugin) in version 1.7, the
file [lsic25.zip] that contains the [Lightning Strike Image Compressor
(LSIC)](documentation.html#lightning-strike-image-compressor-lsic) in
version 2.5, as well as a directory with several [exemplary CIS/COD
images].

Another evidence for the relationship between the two companies are
their addresses. The [Infinop web page][infinop] states the company's
address as *3401 East University #104, Denton, TX 76208*. The
above-mentioned publication states as the address of Compsci,
Inc. *303 N. Carroll, Suite 108, Denton TX 76201*, which is [roughly 5
miles](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NUYagtAU8kUNGD757) apart from the
former location of Infinop, Inc.

Another link between the two companies is via the [former
homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/19990220121339/http://www.compsci.com/%7Echao/)
of [Hongyang
Chao](https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=de&user=qnbpG6gAAAAJ),
which was hosted on compsci.com and states that she is the designer of
the Lightning Strike image compressor, linking to
[infinop.com](https://web.archive.org/web/19990220121339/http://www.infinop.com/).

Looking at other people, [a press release] states that "Craig Fisher"
is "president of Infinop, Inc." and the authors of the above-mentioned
publication are "Oleg Kiselyov and Paul Fisher", who also co-authored
other image compression-related papers, for example, [Image
Compression with Iterated Function Systems, Finite Automata and
Zerotrees: Grand Unification](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0003065)
(submitted to arXiv on March 15, 2000).

[a press release]: https://web.archive.org/web/19970613234255/http://www.infinop.com/nhtml/press.shtml

Although there is no obvious overlap, we do not need to speculate that
Paul Fisher and Craig Fisher might have been relatives since, given
the other clues it seems evident that *Infinop, Inc.*  and *Computer
and Information Sciences, Inc.* were both related to the Lightning
Strike technology.


## Infinitron, Inc.

Weirdly enough, there's another company, *Infinitron, Inc.*, that
seems to have played a role in the codec. It is mentioned in the
[patent WO1998040842A1] that was published in September 17, 1998. The
patent contains the paper *An approach of fast integer reversible
wavelet transform for image compression* written by Hongyang Chao and
Paul Fisher of "Computer and Information Science Inc." [sic] located
at *3401 East University #104, Denton, TX 76208*. That is the address
that Infinop, Inc. gave on its web page and *not* the CSI, Inc. page
from the other paper! The patent also contains a product flyer for the
*Lightning Strike Image Compressor (LSIC)* version 3.0, distributed by
*Infinitron, Inc.*  – also located at *3401 East University #104,
Denton, TX 76208*. And, last but not least, the patent shows HTML
source code to embed an image map that links to www.infinop.com.
