description: An endeavour to understand the CIS-COD raster image format.
---

The aim of this site is to document the
[CIS/COD](http://justsolve.archiveteam.org/wiki/Lightning_Strike)
raster image file format that was developed in the 1990s. An upcoming
series of posts will illuminate various aspects of the format, for
example, its history, technology, and use.
